// Some design decisions:
//
// 1. Don't use a data class:
//    - The generated `copy()` method of data classes allows bypassing validations that may be
//      present in constructors & setters, which is isn't suitable for a domain object that must
//      protect its invariants.
//    - The generated `equals()` method of data classes is more suitable to value objects. An
//      entity equality should only be derived from its ID. While we could override the generated
//      `equals()` method, we find it preferable to keep a default `equals()` method with a
//      "is same" meaning and to explicitly compare IDs when needed.
//
// 2. Don't let the database generate IDs:
//    - That way the domain really is independent, and any entity created in the code has a clear
//      identity.
//    - It's also beneficial to a CQRS approach, though we don't really care in that sample
//      codebase.
//
//
// 3. Otherwise, keep the example simple and take appropriate shortcuts to that end:
//    - While the previous points are strong preferences that we chose to expose here, we're not
//      aiming for a state-of-the-art example on all points (the context is key anyway).
//    - Shortcut 1: while we gave `Task` an `ownerId`, the concept of a `TaskOwner` in itself isn't
//      developed in this codebase. The `ownerId` is enough to introduce real-ish use cases.
//    - Shortcut 2: it's likely that a real system would benefit from having some kind of simple
//      reference or sequence for a given user's tasks, so that they are easier to work with. This
//      would bring additional - unnecessary - complexity to this example, so we'll stick to the
//      quite technical `TaskId`.
